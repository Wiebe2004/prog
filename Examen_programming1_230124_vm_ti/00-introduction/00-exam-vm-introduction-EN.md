# Programming 1 Exam
## 23 January 2024 (AM)

* This exam is intended to be completed within 2 hours and 20 minutes. UCLL has decided that all students automatically receive 30% extra time to accommodate any and all students with exceptional needs. This means that everyone has a total of 3 hours to complete their exam. Keep in mind, this means you must have stopped coding, zipped your files together, uploaded to Toledo, and also checked to be sure that you have submitted all the correct files before the 3 hours is up.


* There are multiple parts to this exam. Before submitting, check to be sure you have solved each part.
  * Question 1: Movies - located within the subfolder `01-Object-Oriented`
    * `assignment_movies.md`: a description of the tasks necessary to complete question 1
    * `movies.py`: a file to write your code
    * `basic_tests_movies.py`: a file with some very basic testing included to check only superficial details like names of functions and parameters
      * any additions, deletions, or changes to this file will not be taken into consideration for the evaluation of this exam
    * Question 1 counts for up to 8 points on the exam.


  * Question 2: Studentdata - located within the subfolder `02-File-IO`
    * `assignment_studentdata.md`: a description of the tasks necessary to complete question 2
    * `studentdata.py`: a file to write your code
    * `studentdata.txt`: a text file that provides input for the tasks in question 2
    * `basic_tests_studentdata.py`: a file with some very basic testing included to check only superficial details like names of functions and parameters
      * any additions, deletions, or changes to this file will not be taken into consideration for the evaluation of this exam
    * Question 2 counts for up to 8 points on the exam.

  * Question 3: Mikado - located within the subfolder `03-Debugging`
    * `assignment_mikado.md`: a description of the tasks necessary to complete question 3
    * `mikado.py`: a file with (imperfect) code already included
    * `mikado_corrected.py`: a file for you to correct the code yourself
    * Question 3 counts for up to 4 points on the exam.


* Reminder: In Visual Studio Code, if you right-click (or control-click) and select Open Preview, markdown files look nicer on your screen.


* At the end of the exam:
  * When you are satisfied with your solution (or if you run out of time), compress all the required files into a zipped folder named `LastName_FirstName.zip` (with your own name).
  * You can upload your zip file in the Submission Zone in x.toledo.ucll.be.
  * Once you have uploaded it, download your submission yourself and check that all content is correct.
  * We cannot award points on the exam for files that are missing or illegible.
